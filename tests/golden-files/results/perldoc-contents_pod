    Net::Z3950::AsyncZ adds an additional layer of asynchronous support for
    the Z3950 module through the use of multiple forked processes. I hope that
    users will also find that it provides a convenient front end to
    "Net::Z3950". My initial idea was to write something that would provide a
    convenient means of processing and formatting Z39.50 records--which I did,
    using the "Z3950" synchronous code. But I also wanted something that could
    handle queries to large numbers of servers at one session. Working on this
    part of my project, I found that I had trouble with the "Z3950"
    asynchronous features and so ended up with what I have here.

    I give a more detailed account in in the [m[38;2;255;255;255m[48;2;0;0;0m[1mDESCRIPTION[m[38;2;255;255;255m[48;2;0;0;0m section of

    AsyncZ.pod
        This is the starting point--it gives an overview of the AsyncZ module,
        describes the basic mechanics of its asynchronous workings, and
        details the particulars of the objects and methods. But see
        ""Examples.pod" for detailed explanations of the sample scripts which
        come with the "Net::Z3950::AsyncZ" distribution.

    Options.pod
        This document details the various options that can be set to modify
        the behavior of AsyncZ Index

    Report.pod
        Report.pod deals with how records are treated line by line and how you
        can affect the apearance of a record's line by line output

    Examples.pod
        This document goes through the sample scripts that come with the
        "Net::Z3950::AsyncZ" distribution and annotates them in a line-by-line
        fashion. It's a basic HOW-TO.

    There are more modules than there is documentation. The reason for this is
    that the only module you have full and complete access to is
    "Net::Z3950::AsyncZ". The other modules are either internal to
    "Net::AsyncZ" or accessed indirectly or in part indirectly.

   Here are the modules:
    Net::Z3950::AsyncZ
        The main module: direct access --documented in "AsyncZ" and "Options"
        documentation

    Net::Z3950::AsyncZ::ErrMsg
        User error message handling: indirect access -- documented in "AsyncZ"
        documentation

    Net::Z3950::AsyncZ::Errors
        Error handling for debugging: limited access -- documented in "AsyncZ"
        documentation

    Net::Z3950::AsyncZ::Report
        Module reponsible for fetching and formatting records: limited access
        -- documented

    Net::Z3950::AsyncZ::ZLoop
        Event loop for child processes: no access -- not documented

    Net::Z3950::AsyncZ::ZSend
        Connection details for child processes: no access -- not documented

    Net::Z3950::AsyncZ::Options::_params
        Options for child processes: direct and indirect access -- documented
        in "Options" and "AsyncZ" documentation
